# RandomApp
An app that is different every time you open it. It could be anything you want it to be like a text editor, or a calculator or a little game.

This project is intended to be a collection of different apps that anyone can develop and add. They will have a random chance to open every time the app is restarted.

The goal of this project is to encourage new developers to create a small app and then add it to this app for educational or recreational purposes. 

Any addition is welcome!
